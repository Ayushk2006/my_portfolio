# Project Images

Place all your project-related images in this folder (`src/assets/images`).

## How to use in React components:

1. Import the image at the top of your file:

   ```jsx
   import myImage from "../assets/images/my-image.png";
   ```

2. Use it in your JSX:
   ```jsx
   <img src={myImage} alt="Description" />
   ```

## Recommended Structure:

- `projects/` - Screenshots of your work
- `profile/` - Your profile pictures
- `icons/` - Custom icons
